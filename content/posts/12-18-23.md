> The fight against this ambiguity is waged in the power of the Spiritual Community, to which unambiguous unity belongs. It is manifest in all attempts to reunite the manifest churches and to draw what we have called the "latent churches' into this union. The most conspicuous of these attempts in our period is the work of the World Council of Churches. The ecumenical movement of which it is the organized representative powerfully expresses the awareness of the predicate of unity in many contemporary churches. In practical terms it is able to heal divisions which have become historically obsolete, to replace confessional fanaticism by interconfessional co-operation, to conquer denominational provincialism, and to produce a new vision of the unity of all churches in their foundation, But neither the ecumenical nor any other future movement can conquer the ambiguity of unity and division in the churches' historical existence. Even if it were able to produce the United Churches of the World, and even if all latent churches were converted to this unity, new divisions would appear. The dynamics of
life, the tendency to preserve the holy even when it has become obsolete, the ambiguities implied in the sociological existence of the churches, and above all, the prophetic criticism and demand for reformation would bring about new and, in many cases, Spiritually justified divisions. The unity of the churches, similar to their holiness, has a paradoxical character. It is the divided church which is the united church.

对于教会的合一与分裂，Paul Tillich用了大概一两页的篇幅就说得比较清楚了。我也觉得很有道理，几乎解决了我思考了太久的难题。可能是之前一直以为有解决的方案，没有想过这里面的机制与内在的矛盾。Tillich用ambiguity这个词来表达生命中遇到的无法解决的悖谬，人在神圣与世俗之间，在个体与集体之间，在有形的教会与无形的教会之间，在信与爱之间，在此世与来世之间，这种状态便是人此世的常态。这是一种生存论的分析，是一种保持detachment的冷静观察。很多批评Tillich的人忘记了这一点，因而说他想要调和哲学与神学之间的隔阂，这是多么大的误解。哲学与神学之间原本就是理不清、割不断的，圣经本身便是证明。

Tillich讲过，也是这些批评者似乎选择忽略的，就是哲学和神学之间的不同态度，一种是involvement，一种是detachment。这是在说人在期间扮演怎样的角色。从神学家的角度来看，神学分析都应该是保持detachment，也就是说保持冷静思考，批判思维。而一般人想要听到直接指导他们生活的“真理”，一种权威的声音，这可能只能在讲台上才能找到，而不是在神学家的思考之中。神学家是反思，是后思，是一种保持一定距离，不让自身的情感胜过理性的克制。批评者需要先回应这个问题，或者说，在意识到这个问题的前提上提出批评。

而一旦注意到Tillich设定的前提，就发现他对现实的审视是多么难以批评，难以用一种detached的眼光审视而不落入偏见：为了批评而批评之中。
