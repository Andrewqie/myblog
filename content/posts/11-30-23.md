> All too ofen it has forgotten that our knowing on earth is a knowing in part and looking into a mirror dimly. Sometimes it seemed to proceed from the idea that it could answer all questions and resolve all issues. It has often been lacking in modesty, tenderness, and simplicity. This was all the worse inasmuch as theology has to do with the deepest problems and comes into contact with the most delicate stirrings of the human heart. More than any other science, it has to take to heart the admonition "not to think of itself more highly than it ought to take" (cf. Rom 12:3). It is better to honestly admit that a thing is not clear than to make a wild guess. "To be willing not to know what the best Teacher does not wish to teach---that is learned ignorance." But this is not to condemn theology in theology.

这是Bavinck在其*Reformed Dogmatics*第一卷605页的一段话，目的是批判十九世纪的新教神学家，批评他们对教义的敌对态度，想要另辟蹊径在一种新的社会知识环境下，为有“学识的人”（这是Bavinck对当时新教神学的论断）构建一套新的神学体系。在一定程度上，我认为我可以理解他为什么会这么说，因为这些新教神学家，将神学建立在哲学之上，许多概念和理论已然超越普通人所能理解和承受的范围。神学俨然已成为了上层社会保持其信仰的理论玩具，已然与大众完全脱离了。这些精妙的理论，在Bavinck看来是种知识上的骄傲，好像只有他们才搞懂了真理。

那么Bavinck如何解决他自己的神学不陷入这种精英主义式的陷阱呢？难道他写的四卷本的教义学（2400多页密密麻麻的字）不是那种对知识的追求，以至于脱离了一般人可以理解的范围吗？在第一卷的最后一段，他似乎想到了这个问题，并且试图为之辩护。他说，神学和信仰是两回事，一般人不需要学习神学科学，不可能也没必要。

> Faith pauses to consider the facts; theology, on the other hand, attempts to get down to the idea. Faith is content with the *that*; theology inquires into the *why* and the *how*. Faith is always personal; it always relates the object to persons themselves and is directly interested in the religious content of the dogmas. Theology, on the other hand, in a sense "objectivizes" the object; it attempts to see the truth as it objectively exists in itself. It explores its unity and inner coherence and seeks to arrive at a system. Faith focuses directly on the central object; theology expands its horizon to the entire cicumference. But, however diverse the two may be, they cannot do without each other. Faith preserves theology from secularization; theology perserves faith from separatism. For that reason the church and the school (seminary, department of theology and religion), though two entities, ought to be in solidarity with each other...theology does not occupy a position high above real life but is situated in its midst, in the life of the Christian community. The distorted relation that everywhere exists today between the church and theology is a disaster for both.

在Bavinck的处境下，在学术和教会渐行渐远的情况之中，这可能是他所能想出来的最好的应对方式了。我不能说在今天这是否仍旧是理想的模式，但这个问题仍旧存在于西方教会之中。这种关切是我欣赏的。
