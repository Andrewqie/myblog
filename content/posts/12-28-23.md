对于中国教会的状况来说，了解自身的处境和现实是当务之急的事情。理解自身是件重要但艰难的事，尤其是一直以来相对闭塞的神学，令人窒息的政治环境，使得诚实的社会研究难以维系。但即便如此，教会都应该努力去了解普通人的生活，了解他们的真实处境和心理状态，才能知道福音如何对他们说话。教会的使命也取决于此。与普通人无关的福音不是上帝的福音，不为弱者说话的福音不是上帝的福音，教会自身就满了不公的教会不是真正的教会。真正显明其本质的是爱和盼望的行动，而行动又显明了其真正的神学。

> In the final analysis, poverty means death: lack of food and housing, the inability to attend properly to health and education needs, the exploitation of workers, permanent unemployment, the lack of respect for one's human dignity, and unjust limitations placed on personal freedom in the areas of self-expression, politics, and religion. Poverty is a situation that destroys peoples, families, and individuals; Medellín and Puebla called it "institutionalized violence (to which must be added the equally unacceptable violence of terrorism and repression).

对中国人来说，“解放”这两词有独特的含义，其原本的意义是正面的，应对人的生存处境。但在中国人特有的政治历史与当下，这个词是带着政治创伤的，因而人听到这个词之后的反应多是负面的，警觉的，与流血和革命相关的。所以在很多人的耳中，解放神学这几个字意味着社会主义，意味着革命，意味着肤浅的外在的政治改革。但若想要拒绝或反驳“解放神学”，就需要理解此种神学对贫穷的真正理解是什么。这种人面临的窘境，明显不只是拉美人民正在遭遇的，这是世界上大多数人的困境。这种“处境神学”，与其说是拉美人的特殊境遇，不如说是人之为人的境遇。人尊严的丧失，生活条件的匮乏，政治、经济上遭遇的压迫、不公，是所有国家民族都在遭遇的境遇。在一定意义上，有人在的地方，就需要解放神学。

> One of the first statements of my way of understanding the theological task was that liberation theology is "a critical reflection on Christian praxis in light of the word of God. The point of this was not to try to reduce the riches of a quest to a short definition, but rather to point out a path to be followed.

> The praxis on which liberation theology reflects is a praxis of solidarity in the interests of liberation and is inspired by the gospel. It is the activity of "peacemakers that is, those who are forging shalom. Western languages translate this Hebrew word as "peace" but in doing so, diminish its meaning. Shalom in fact refers to the whole of life and, as part of this, to the need of establishing justice and peace. Consequently, a praxis motivated by evangelical values embraces to some extent every effort to bring about authentic fellowship and authentic justice. 

> If there is no friendship with them and no sharing of the life of the poor, then there is no authentic commitment to liberation, because love exists only among equals. Any talk of liberation necessarily refers to a comprehensive process, one that embraces everyone.

明显，很多人指责这种解放神学过于关注外在的物质，忽略了精神上的富裕。但Gustavo辩护说，真正对穷苦之人的关心是与他们成为朋友，意思是与他们成为平等的人，然后才能看到他们真实的生活，看到他们深沉的祷告。

> In other words, the distinction of two phases in theological work is not simply an academic question; it is, above all, a matter of lifestyle, a way of living the faith. Being part of the life of our people, sharing their sufferings and joys, their concerns and their struggles, as well as the faith and hope that they live as a Christian community—all this is not a formality required if one is to do theology; it is a requirement for being a Christian.

教会的使命应当包括对穷人的关心，而不是与之相冲突。“神学是反思，是对行动的批判性思考，只发生在黄昏时分。神学并不产生行动，而是对行动的思考。”而神学反过来对行动发出批评，促使行为的改变，如先知一般宣布上帝的国。神学并不只是智慧和理性的知识，神学需要这两者，但神学还需要是更多的东西。“This is a theology which does not stop with reflecting on the world, but rather tries to be part of the process through which the world is transformed.It is a theology which is open—in the protest against trampled human dignity, in the struggle against the plunder of the vast majority of humankind, in liberating love, and in the building of a new, just, and comradely society—to the gift of the Kingdom of God.”这可谓是解放神学的核心了。

> theology as wisdom and theology as rational knowledge

> By preaching the Gospel message, by its sacraments, and by the charity of its members, the Church proclaims and shelters the gift of the Kingdom of God in the heart of human history. The Christian community professes a "faith which works through charity." It is at least ought to be—real charity, action, and commitment to the service of others. Theology is reflection, a critical attitude. Theology follows; it is the second step. What Hegel used to say about philosophy can likewise be applied to theology: it rises only at sundown. The pastoral activity of the Church does not flow as a conclusion from theological premises. Theology does not produce pastoral activity; rather it reflects upon it. Theology must be able to find in pastoral activity the presence of the Spirit inspiring the action of the Christian community.

> "The hermeneutics of the Kingdom of God," observed Schillebeeckx, "consists especially in making the world a better place. Only in this way will I be able to discover what the Kingdom of God means."

> The goal is not only better living conditions, a radical change of structures, a social revolution; it is much more: the continuous creation, never ending, of a new way to be human, a permanent cultural revolution.
要理解争取解放的最终目的，上面这段说得好。在此之前，Gustavo引用了Marcuse，后者对当今社会中存在的压迫与控制有相当精妙的分析，有让人大开眼界之感。很多现象在教会的处境中普遍存在，却无人知晓。

Gustavo触及到的解放问题，或者说自由问题，是中国教会一直都在侧重的基督徒行动问题。意思是说，许多人不喜欢沉思式的神学，而喜欢强调“行出”上帝的真理，这也正是Gustavo所说的另一种可以改变社会现实的层面。不过，中国信徒所谓的“行动”大多限制在教会这个小范围之内，眼睛所看到的也多是一种脱离肉身的精神层面。对肉身的富足和满足有着“天然”的怀疑（我怀疑是和中国本身的文化特质有一定联系），或许，Gustavo的角度会对中国的信徒有很多启发。

> To speak about a theology of liberation is to seek an answer to the following question: **what relation is there between salvation and the historical process of human liberation?** 

> To be a Christian is to accept and to live—in solidarity, in faith, hope, and charity—the meaning that the Word of the Lord and our encounter with that Word give to the historical becoming of humankind on the way toward total communion. To regard the unique and absolute relationship with God as the horizon of every human action is to place oneself, from the outset, in a wider and more profound context.
这可能是对“人是社会性的动物”的基督教式的阐释，在我迄今为止的经验之中，他所说的的确是事实，我们作为基督徒不可能对政治层面，对这个社会的结构和发展置身事外。关键是，如何进行政治活动，目标是什么？一种更好的、贴合人性实际的“自由”状态是什么？

Gustavo对世俗化的解释相当有意思，与一般的嘲讽和敌对态度（这种简单粗暴的处理方式）截然不同。一般对世俗化的敌对来自于对所谓“圣约”群体的理想化崇拜，一种圣俗之间的分割，一种逃离世界的渴望，一种对在地如在天的乌托邦式的构建。在这个意义上，这种对世界的态度虽然是可以理解的，但这种神圣群体的理想无异于是这个冷酷世界之中的鸦片。

> The liberation of our continent means more than overcoming economic, social, and political dependence. It means, in a deeper sense, to see the becoming of humankind as a process of human emancipation in history. It is to see humanity in search of a qualitatively different society in which it will be free from all servitude, in which it will be the artisan of its own destiny. It is to seek the building up of a new humanity.

虽然这听起来有些荒诞，但追求一种可以克服资本主义的问题的解决方式，似乎并不能立刻便称之为一种遥不可及的乌托邦。对于现今正在“崛起”的中国来说，由于中美关系的进一步恶化，中国人在国际上的形像进一步被标签化。而中国的极权政府，对于本国公民施行的言论压制，导致真正的问题无法被揭示出来。先前活跃的学者而今很难发表任何建设性和批判性的文字，使得中国社会中的压迫问题进一步隐没。人们在网络上以隐晦的方式表达工作、生活中遇到的巨大压力，在网络与技术浸透到人们生活方方面面的今天，人们的生活和情感进一步被压榨。而教会则在方方面面被推到社会的边缘。这是中国与拉美情况的不同之处，教会在思考如何为受压迫者的“自由”作出贡献的时候，明显缺少拉美教会在政治上的影响力，因而需要从另外的角度出发回应这个问题。

当拉美教会发现自身需要与“贫穷”之人站在一起，北美教会发现自身需要和被压迫的黑人站在一起之时，或许对中国教会来说，一个比较明显的角度是和那些在日常的工作当中疲累不堪，在生活的重压之下无法娱乐的人站在一起，而不是以一种“圣洁”的姿态嘲讽那些因为压力不愿来到教会的人，教会应当成为宣布“自由”之福音的场所，而不是人们从一种高压的环境逃离出来又入了另一个高压环境的地方。如果教会堕入一种单纯让人遵守某种诫命，在人际关系上戴上虚假的面具，无法以“自由”的主动性改变自己的状态，教会就是另一种形式上的极权政府，不过是外在的权力模式在教会之内的投射。

中国教会，无论是三自教会还是地下教会，都与政治有种扭曲的关系。无论是地上还是地下的教会，他们都试图远离政治领域，自觉与一种权力体系划清界限。这固然是一种自保的方式，在对政治和权力极端敏感的极权政府统治之下，对政治的自觉远离是使自身不受到伤害的方式。但问题在于，这种远离使得信众对政府这个无孔不入的暴力机构无法理解，在“创造天地的主”之认信上，无法与自身的处境和现实相联系，理论无法解释眼前的现象。于是对政府所做的任何举动，往往会出现情绪极端的反应。在社会的层面，由于中国社会自古以来缺少合法的民间机构，公平和公正的诉求都是普通人对权力拥有者，也就是对政府作出的。当极权政府自身成为一个暴力机关，不公的化身的时候。社会公义就成了一种真空。教会应当担当的角色，是与社会之中遭遇各种不公的人站在一起，成为上帝国度的彰显，末后的盼望。真正的落脚点，不是与暴力机构的对抗，而是直接面对不公的现实，勇敢担当。

想要成为公平的担当，教会就必须面对其内部成员之间所发生的不公。面对教会内部的权力不对等导致的不公事件，例如担任神职的人对一般信徒的侵犯，当一般信徒试图在神职人员面前寻求公正的裁决之时遭遇的冷漠甚至再一次的不公对待，教会应当作世上的光。当这个社会上所有的组织，包括政府机构，公司，学校，都对不公平漠视的时候，这正是教会首当其冲的责任。换句话说，教会应当比这个社会更有道德。当中国的信徒在呼唤一种行动的神学之时，这是行动首要的意义。教会也会在这种公义的建造之中，越加有力量去面对暴力和不公，从而有力量在极权政权之下对其有更好的理解，在此之上，才会形成改变的力量。

> The problem, however, is not only to find a new theological framework. The personal and community prayer of many Christians committed to the process of liberation is undergoing a serious crisis. This could purify prayer life of childish attitudes, routine, and escapes. But it will not do this if new paths are not broken and new spiritual experiences are not lived. For example, without "contemplative life, to use a traditional term, there is no authentic Christian life; yet what this contemplative life will be is still unknown. There is great need for a spirituality of liberation; yet in Latin America those who have opted to participate in the process of liberation as we have outlined it above, comprise, in a manner of speaking, a first Christian generation. In many areas of their life they are without a theological and spiritual tradition. They are creating their own.

> In order to reflect on what action the Latin American Church should take and to act accordingly, it is necessary to consider its historical and social coordinates, its here and now. To neglect doing this is to remain on an abstract and ahistorical theological level; or, perhaps more subtly, it is to remain on the level of a theology more concerned with avoiding past errors than with discovering the originality of the present situation and committing itself to tomorrow.

> Salvation is not something otherworldly, in regard to which the present life is merely a test. Salvation—the communion of human beings with God and among themselves—is something which embraces all human reality, transforms it, and leads it to its fullness in Christ: "Thus the center of God's salvific design is Jesus Christ, who by his death and resurrection transforms the universe and makes it possible for the person to reach fulfillment as a human being. This fulfillment embraces every aspect of humanity: body and spirit, individual and society, person and cosmos, time and eternity. Christ, the image of the Father and the perfect God-Man, takes on all the dimensions of human existence."

> To work, to transform this world, is to become a man and to build the human community; it is also to save. Likewise, to struggle to be against misery and exploitation and to build a just society is already to be part of the saving action, which is moving towards its complete fulfillment. All this means that building the temporal city is not simply a stage of "humanization" or "pre-evangelization as was held in theology until a few years ago. Rather it is to become part of a saving process which embraces the whole of humanity and all human history. Any theological reflection on human work and social praxis ought to be rooted in this fundamental affirmation.

Gustavo明显是意识到追求“改变”和“希望”，以及未来的“乌托邦”理想可能会带来的危险，一种意识形态化的危险。在追求“正义”和“公平”的途中，倡导者极有可能会因为这种行动本身获得极大的权力，从而将自身陷入被批判的境地。而人的软弱和罪极容易在正义的诉求中毁掉自己，我们见过太多这样的例子。从而使得人们怀疑追求本身的正当性。这是极为可悲的事。当受压迫者一旦尝到压迫者一直享有的“好处”之时，他们便无法控制自己，自己变成了压迫者的样子。这或许是耶稣上十字架的隐喻，在一次又一次被人推举成为王的试探之中，他一次又一次拒绝。这正是追求公平和公义者的警钟，也是人之在世的无法逃避的命运。

> In Latin America the world in which the Christian community must live and celebrate its eschatological hope is the world of social revolution; the Church's task must be defined in relation to this. Its fidelity to the Gospel leaves it no alternative: the Church must be the visible sign of the presence of the Lord within the aspiration for liberation and the struggle for a more human and just society. Only in this way will the message of love which the Church bears be made credible and efficacious.
这不只是拉美教会的使命，而是所有教会的使命。

> In Latin America this denunciation must represent a radical critique of the present order, which means that the Church must also criticize itself as an integral part of this order. This horizon will allow the Church to break out of its narrow enclosure of intraecclesial problems by placing these problems in their true context—the total society and the broad perspective of commitment in a world of revolutionary turmoil.
没错，教会就应当有自我批评的勇气。

> The gospel proclaims God's love for every human being and calls us to love as God loves. Yet recognition of the fact of class struggle means taking a position, opposing certain groups of persons, rejecting certain activities, and facing hostilities. For if we are convinced that peace indeed supposes the establishment of justice, we cannot remain passive or indifferent when the most basic human rights are at risk. That kind of behavior would not be ethical or Christian. Conversely, our active participation on the side of justice and in defense of the weakest members of society does not mean that we are encouraging conflict; it means rather that we are trying to eliminate its deepest root, which is the absence of love.

> The promise of unity is at the heart of Christ's work; in him human beings are sons and daughters of the Father and brothers and sisters to one another. The church, the community of those who confess Christ as their Lord, is a sign of unity within history (Constitution on the Church, 1). For this reason, the church must help the world to achieve unity, while knowing that "unity among human beings is possible only if there is real justice for all."
