在不同宗派、神学观点、立场之间寻求共同根基的大公运动，在过去几十年里一直是热门的话题，甚至持续到今天。George Lindbeck所写的The Nature of Doctrine应该是在这个背景下的思考之结果，他试图在保守派的propositionalism以及自由派的experential-expressivism之间寻求第三条道路，他将之命名为cultural-linguistic approach。

他的论证最能说服我的是，他可以在不同的truth claims之间剥开文化-语言影响下的形式，使人看到内核中的共通点。在保守派和自由派相对独断的态度之中，Lindbeck试图开拓一种更为深刻和理性的对话方式。这种进路强调对文化环境与信仰表达、个体情感之间进行descriptive的叙述，注意到个体的神学、教义、经验的表述都受到cultural-linguistic grammar的决定性影响。在传统的以教义为中心的模式与自由派以个体经验为中心的进路之间，这种折中进路讲求以圣经叙事与个体之间的intratextuality。以叙事为主的讲道方式似乎也与此有关。

对我启发最大的倒不是上面所说的这些论点，而是这种cultural-linguistic的研究方法对处理不同宗教之间关系的主张。简单来说，某个宗教或教派各自有其独特的cultural-linguistic matrix，只有以一种descriptive的方式才可以完整呈现其本真的部分，也只有这样，不同宗教之间才可能有真正的对话，甚至彼此相互学习。这应用在宣教的领域也同样适用，相信已有专门的文章或书籍回应过这个问题。

而最近在中国的一间教会里，传道人allegely性侵多名妇女。In as much as this person should be prosecuted for his crimes, 信徒的反应更让人觉得可悲和讶异。很多信徒认为此人在社交网络上发表的“悔改言辞”（甚至在他的悔改词里都没有具体提到原因）便已经足够让他脱罪得赦免了。而也有一些此人先前得罪过的人在一旁冷嘲热讽，大有幸灾乐祸之意。在中国教会的cultural-linguistic语境中，这些行为和反应的缘由是什么，是我比较关注的问题。在这种罪行和反应的背后，到底是怎样的文化语言机制导致了这种对罪恶的冷漠以及对人的冷漠？在教会发生的现象与中国社会的文化大背景之间，到底存在怎样的关联？我认为这是最值得去研究和探讨的问题。


The ecumenical movement, seeking a common foundation among different denominations, theological viewpoints, and stances, has been a hot topic for the past few decades and continues even today. 'The Nature of Doctrine' written by George Lindbeck should be a result of reflections in this context. He attempts to find a third way between conservative propositionalism and liberal experiential-expressivism, which he names the cultural-linguistic approach.

What convinces me most in his argument is that he can peel off the cultural-linguistic influences from different truth claims, allowing people to see the common core within. Amidst the relatively dogmatic attitudes of conservatives and liberals, Lindbeck tries to forge a deeper and more rational way of dialogue. This approach emphasizes a descriptive narrative of the interaction between cultural context and faith expression, individual experience, acknowledging that individuals' theological, doctrinal, and experiential expressions are determined by the cultural-linguistic grammar. Between the traditional doctrine-centered model and the liberal individual-experience-centered approach, this middle path advocates for the intratextuality between Biblical narratives and the individual faith journey. The narrative-oriented preaching style seems to be related to this as well.

What inspires me the most, however, is not the arguments mentioned above, but how this cultural-linguistic research method deals with the relationships between different religions. Simply put, each religion or denomination has its unique cultural-linguistic matrix, and only a descriptive method can fully present its true essence. Only then can there be genuine dialogue between different religions, and even mutual learning. This is also applicable in the field of missions, and I believe there are already specific articles or books addressing this issue.

Recently, in a church in China, a preacher allegedly sexually assaulted multiple women. As much as this individual should be prosecuted for his crimes, the reaction of the believers is even more sorrowful and astonishing. Many believers think that the "repentance words" he posted on social media (even though his repentance did not specifically mention the reasons) are sufficient for him to be absolved of his sins. There are also some whom this person had previously offended, who are now mocking and gloating at his downfall. In the cultural-linguistic context of the Chinese church, what are the reasons behind these behaviors and reactions? This is my primary concern. What cultural and linguistic mechanisms underlie this indifference to sin and to people? What is the relationship between the phenomena occurring in the church and the broader cultural background of Chinese society? I believe these are the most worthwhile questions to research and discuss.
