The theology of the people of God, wandering in the faith of Abraham and Sarah, is a theology of the way - a *theologia viae* - not yet a theology of the home country, a *theologia patriae*. It is a theology of exile and exodus, and in all its images and concepts it bears the stamp of the far-off land itself out of which these images and concepts are to lead us. The lament "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?" (Ps. 137.4) is the lament of theology, too, in this world, estranged as it is from God.

我喜欢这个概念和表达，主要基于我过去追求神学的经验。在各种声音和观点之中，Moltmann所写的这段话最能打动我。
