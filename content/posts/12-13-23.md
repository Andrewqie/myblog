> ...The other side of the correlation is the influence of the existential questions on the theological answers. But it should be reaffirmed that the answers cannot be derived from the questions, that the substance of the answers---the revelatory experience---is independent of the questions. But the form of the theological answer is *not* independent of the form of the existential question. If theology gives the answer, "the Christ," to the question implied in human estrangement, it does do differently, depending on whether the reference is to the existential conflicts of Jewish legalism, to the existential despair of Greek skepticism, or to the threat of nihilism as expressed in twentieth-century literature, art, and psychology. Nevertheless, the question does not create the answer. The answer, "the Christ," cannot be created by man, but man can receive it and express it according to the way he has asked for it.

在Tillich的书写中，即使他写得再抽象，我总是可以在反复表述的语言中看到他想要表达的中心。在看似复杂的语言中，可以看到他对人性局限的敏锐，也意识到语言表达的局限，明白上帝的不可言说性，语言的象征性，辩证表达的必要性。思想总是流动，无法用标签说明的。我困惑于不同的学者给他贴上的标签，在传统神学家的表述中，大多数都是从外在的世界出发，或是理解圣经，或是理解自然，但很少有人从理解人的困境出发。

> The world is not reconciled, either in the individual---as Kierkegaard shows---or in society---as Marx shows---or in life as such---as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche show. Existence is estrangement and not reconciliation; it is dehumanization and not the expression of essential humanity. It is the process in which man becomes a thing and ceases to be a person. History is not the divine self-manifestation but a series of unreconciled conflicts, threatening man with self-destruction. The existence of the individual is filled with anxiety and threatened by meaninglessness. With this description of man's predicament all existentialists agree and are therefore opposed to Hegel's essentialism. They feel that it is an attempt to hide the truth about man's actual state.

> In existential thinking, the object is involved. In non-existential thinking, the object is detached. By its very nature, theology is existential; by its very nature, science is non-existential. Philosophy unites elements of both. In intention, it is non-existential; in reality, it is an ever changing combination of elements of involvement and detachment.

我认为Tillich以上这段话基本上精准地写出了我的真实经验，我对科学、哲学、神学的经验。在一定程度上，神学也不一定是existential的，很多人写神学的方法与他们对神学的认知都是科学性的。意思是，他们有意要避免一种生存性的介入，例如Barth、Pannenberg。但Barth在《福音神学》这个小册子里讨论了神学家本身的局限，或者这是他做的一些补充吧。

> Only he who is able to have solitude is able to have communion. For in solitude man experiences the dimension of the ultimate, the true basis for communion among those who are alone. In existential estrangement man is cut off from the dimensions of the ultimate and is left alone---in loneliness. This loneliness, however, is intolerable. It drives man to a type of participation in which he surrenders his lonely self to the "collective".

> But in this surrender the individual is accepted not by any other individual but only by that to which they have all surrendered their potential solitude, that is, the spirit of the collective. Therefore the individual continues to seek for the other one and is rejected, in part or in full; for the other one is also a lonely individual, unable to have communion because he is unable to have solitude. Such a rejection is the source of much hostility not only against those who reject one but also against one's self. In this way the essential structure of solitude and communion is distorted by existential estrangement into a source of infinite suffering. Destruction of others and self-destruction are interdependent in the dialectics of loneliness.

Tillich用生存论分析将基督教传统的神学概念重新解析，将人生活的现实清晰而犀利地展现在读者面前。这比一般神学家以传统神学概念解释起来更与我们的生存处境相关，而不是仅仅简单地在复述已经陈旧的内容。这正是与奥古斯丁对原罪的苦苦思索所做的类似工作。在一定意义上，Tillich的工作是延续修院的灵修传统，与哲学式向外思索的方式不同，他的工作是深入人的内心，人的意识，是对自身的反思。但与古代灵修传统中神秘主义的进路不同，他的工作又是理性式的，与外界相关的。虽然强调involvement，但仍可以保持一定的detachment。这是Tillich所说，敬虔主义容易丧失批评性思维的危险。
