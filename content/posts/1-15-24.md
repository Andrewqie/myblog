James Cone的神学之所以那么“难懂”，不是因为他用语艰深，或是其文字风格仿佛对他影响最大的Barth，而是他的神学是站在Oppressed的境地而发出的声音，用今天人们更能理解的话，是traumatized之处境下的神学。仿佛是在一群指责victim也犯了罪的人中间为the perpetrator辩护一般，James Cone的语气激烈只有在这种情形下才能得到理解。不过，谁又能说耶稣不是这样的victim呢？在那个由罪恶的权势掌管的制度之下（而今又何尝不是呢？），耶稣的死，除了一些落泪的妇女，又有谁站在他一边呢？由此，我们才能明白复活的意义，那是上帝站在victim一边，上帝亲自宣告他与oppressed, traumatized victim站在一边。

所以，时至今日，James Cone仍是值得每个人阅读的，不只是研读神学的人（Cone made it clear that theological education has nothing to do with Christian living），而是每个寻求上帝公义的人。在Martin Luther King Jr Day, Cone论及King的话时至今日仍是适切的：

> From the foregoing analysis of violence and nonviolence, it is obvious that I do not share Martin Luther King, Jr.'s explication of this issue, although I agreed with much of the actual programmatic thrust of his leadership. His dependence on the analysis of love found in liberal theology and his confidence that “the universe is on the side of justice”29 seem not to take seriously white violence in America. I disagreed with his conceptual analysis of violence versus nonviolence, because his distinctions between these terms did not appear to face head-on the historical and sociological complexities of human existence in a racist society. Thus much of King's writings reflect theological and philosophical discourse that had little to do with his actual creative thinking and acting. The source of the latter is not Gandhi or Boston personalism, despite his implied claims to the contrary. King's creative thought and power in the struggle of freedom were found in his black Church heritage. This was the heritage that brought him face to face with agony and despair but also hope and joy that somewhere in the bosom of God's eternity, justice would become a reality “in the land of the free and the home of the brave.” This was the source of King's dream and his anticipation that “trouble won't last always.” With black sermonic style and rhythm and with theological imagination, he attempted to explicate the content of his vision: “I have a dream,” he said at the March on Washington in 1963, “that one day my children will no longer be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” And the night before his assassination in Memphis, he reiterated a similar hope: “I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.” The idea that hope is created in the context of despair and oppression is what made King such a creative activist and a great preacher and theologian. It is also what makes my theology very similar to King's, despite our apparent difference on violence and nonviolence. For we both recognize that a fight is on and black survival and liberation are at stake. Therefore, we do not need to debate the relative merits of certain academic distinctions between violence and force or violence and nonviolence. The task is what King demonstrated so well in his life and thought, to try to replace inhumanity with humanity.
