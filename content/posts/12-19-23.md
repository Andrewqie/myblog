Tillich对历史有极深的见解，参见他ST, III, 300ff.

> The term "materialistic dialectics" is ambiguous and dangerous because of its ambiguity. The term "materialistic" can be understood as metaphysical materialism (which was strongly rejected by Marx) or as moral materialism (which he attacked as the characteristic of bourgeois society). Both interpretations are wrong. Rather, materialism, in connection with dialectics, expresses the belief that the economic-social conditions of a society determine all other cultural forms and that the movement of the economic-social basis has a dialectical character which produces tensions and conflicts in a social situation and drives beyond them toward a new economic-social stage. It is obvious that the dialectical character of this materialism excludes metaphysical materialism and includes the element of the new which Hegel called "synthesis" and which cannot be reached without historical action---as Marx himself realized and applied in practice. The relative truth of social dislectics, rooted in economic conflicts, cannot be denied, but truth becomes error if this kind of dialectics is raised to the status of a law for all history. Then it becomes a quasi-religious principle and loses any empirical verifiability.

> It was the great mistake of the classicistic art criticism to see in the Greek and Renaissance styles the norm for visual arts, by which everything else was to be measured as either progress toward it or regression from it or relegated to a state of primitive impotence. The justified reaction against this doctrine in our century has sometimes gone to unjustified extremes in the opposite direction, but it has established the principle of the essentially non-progressive character of the history of the arts.

> The history of philosophy clearly shows that none of the great philosophical solutions has ever become obsolete, although their scientific observations and theories soon become antiquated. And it is only consistent that some analytic philosophers reject the entire history of philosophy before the rise of analytic philosophy because they see no, or little, progress in it toward what they believe to be the only task of philosophy: logical and semantic analysis.

在我过去的教会经历中，遇到过很多令我疑惑不解的问题，有些难题甚至让我对信仰本身产生了动摇。虽然我也认识很多读过神学书的人，身边也有不少教授学者，但没有一个人推荐过Paul Tillich的*Systematic Theology*。现在想来感觉有些不可思议，但我若在信主之后读过此书，相信在信仰求索的路上也不至于遇到那么多弯路。当然，可能这也是更好的结果，让我对此书的理解更深。此书与一般的系统神学有很多不同，除了我先前提到的角度之外，此书教给了我许多“智慧”，类似旧约中的《箴言》和《传道书》。

Tillich在书中反复提及nationlism，fundamentalism，peitism，我认为这正是中国当下处境中最大的几个问题。在当下的神学对话中，Tillich研究应当有很多要讲的话。
